# Programmming: Principals and Practice Using C++, 2nd Ed. Notes

Although most of the notes associated with the reading of this book, this
README will server as "digital scratch paper" for any "general" notes while
working through the book.

## Chapter 2 Notes

* To compile: `g++ -std=c++11 -o <executable_filename> <input_c++_filename>.cpp`

## Chapter 3 Notes

* On OSX (currently on 10.14.6), there are multiple different compilers in
`/usr/bin`. The `c++` "compiler" is not actually a compiler, but rather a
symlink to the `clang++` compiler. Other compilers include `g++` and `gcc`.
